# Vercel Analytics Implementation

## Overview
Vercel Analytics has been successfully integrated into the Stratigo portfolio website to track user interactions and provide valuable insights about visitor behavior.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Installation
The `@vercel/analytics` package is already installed in the project dependencies.

### 2. Basic Setup
Analytics is initialized in `src/main.js` using the `inject()` function:

```javascript
import { inject } from '@vercel/analytics'
inject()
```

### 3. Custom Event Tracking
A Vue composable (`src/composables/useAnalytics.js`) provides methods for tracking custom events:

- `trackEvent(eventName, properties)` - Track any custom event
- `trackFormSubmission(formType, additionalData)` - Track form submissions
- `trackButtonClick(buttonName, section)` - Track button clicks
- `trackServiceInterest(serviceName)` - Track service interest
- `trackNavigation(destination)` - Track navigation events

### 4. Tracked Events
